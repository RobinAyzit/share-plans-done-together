DoneTogether is a free collaborative planning app for families and friends.
Create a shared plan, invite others with a link, and check items off together
in real time. You can also attach location reminders (enter or leave a place)
so people get notified when they need them most.

## Why it exists

The project started as a simple to-do idea and quickly grew into something more:
shared family plans plus GPS reminders for everyday life (medicine, school runs,
shopping lists, and similar).

It was prototyped with Google AI Studio, then developed further locally with
Cursor, OpenCode, and Codex agents over many months until it was ready for
public use.

## Privacy

DoneTogether is built to stay simple. There is no advertising stack and no
unnecessary personal data collection beyond what is needed to run accounts,
plans, and optional push/location features you choose to enable.

The operator admin view only shows high-level usage counts (for example how
many people use the app or have installed it). It is not a tool for reading
other users’ private plan contents.
